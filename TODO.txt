All:
   Ensure your toString() prints the type of object first
   Rename type to TYPE (IT IS A FINAL CONSTANT!)
   Ensure your latest version works with the latest Shape.java (pull it, it has changed)
     
Rectangle:
   Fix error with length, see your constructor

Circle:
   Store either the radius or the diameter, calculate everything else
   circumference() should be a method
   
Equilateral: 
    Rename class
 
 
 
 Questions:
 
 - What is the best way to handle the TYPE information?
 - How could we include an interface
 - Should we force every shape to have a perimeter method - even though not all shapes actually have one?
 - What other shapes should we add
 - How could we add the ability to draw the shapes?  What data would we need?  What methods?
 - Given a simple java graphics class, could you add code that would draw your shape?

 Using the Tricky Polymorphism Worksheet for a guide, in your own tester class
 
 - Write some legal method calls
 - Write some calls that result in compiler errors
 - Write some calls that result in method errors      
 
 You may copy/paste any methods from the ShapeTesterTK to your tester.
