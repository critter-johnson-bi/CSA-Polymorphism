All:
   Ensure your toString() prints the type of object first
   Rename type to TYPE (IT IS A FINAL CONSTANT!)
   Ensure your latest version works with the latest Shape.java (pull it, it has changed)
     
Rectangle:
   Fix error with length, see your constructor

Circle:
   Store either the radius or the diameter, calculate everything else
   circumference() should be a method
   
Equilateral: 
    Rename class
 
 
 
 Questions:
 
 - What is the best way to handle the TYPE information?  
      - Where does the declaration belong if we want EVERY shape to have one.
 - How could we include an interface
 
 - Should we force every shape to have a perimeter method - even though not all shapes actually have one?
      - if we do, should circle also have a circumference?
      
 - What other shapes should we add
      - Regular Polygons
      - Irregular Polygons
      - Others?
       
 - How could we add the ability to draw the shapes?  What data would we need?  What methods?
      - Should everything for drawing be in the Shapes Interface or another interface, why?
 
 - Given a simple java graphics class, could you add code that would draw your shape?  
       - 
       
 - When drawing a shape, you don't want to draw it off of the screen.
         - If you know the size of the frame and the position and size of the object, you can 
               make sure that you don't draw it if it is not completely on the frame, but
               that requires each shape to have a size ... is it reasonable to require that each
               shape provide a getWidth9) and a getLength()?
               
 - Should our shapes have their own speed?  Or, should those be stored somewhere else?
      Should we have graphics objects that have
         Location
         Speed
         Whether they should be drawn or not

 Using the Tricky Polymorphism Worksheet for a guide, in your own tester class
 
      - Write some legal method calls
      - Write some calls that result in compiler errors
      - Write some calls that result in method errors      
 
 You may copy/paste any methods from the ShapeTesterTK to your tester.
