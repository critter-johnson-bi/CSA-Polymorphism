All:
   Ensure your toString() prints the type of object first
   Rename type to TYPE (IT IS A FINAL CONSTANT!)
     
Rectangle:
   Fix error with length, see your constructor

Circle:
   Store either the radius or the diameter, calculate everything else
   circumference() should be a method
   
Equilateral: 
    Rename class
